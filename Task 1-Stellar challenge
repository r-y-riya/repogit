        <h2>Some Facts</h2>
        <p>DEFINITION:
Moore's Law has been a guiding force in the semiconductor industry for planning research and development goals.

In turn, it has led to the prevalence of affordable yet microscopic transistors that have shaped all facets of society.

From consumer smartphones to weather forecasting to life-saving hospital equipment, every economic sector has seen improvements in productivity and efficiency due to the shrinking size of transistors.

<br>
<br>

LIMITATIONS:
There is a limit to Mooreâ€™s Law. Most experts agree that the physical limits of transistor technology should be reached sometime in the 2020s

<br>
<br>
<br>

POSITIVE IMPACT:
Moore's Law has led to the prevalence of affordable yet microscopic transistors that have shaped all facets of society.</p>
